# QUICK_CHECK 

🚀 **Excited to announce that I've completed my first-ever Android app built with Flutter!**

I’ve been diving into mobile app development and this basic **ToDo App** is my first milestone. The app allows users to:

- ✅ **Add tasks**
- 📝 **Mark tasks as complete**
- ❌ **Delete tasks**

This project helped me get hands-on experience with **Flutter** and **Dart**, while also deepening my understanding of:

- Basics of OOP concepts
- State management
- Building responsive UI components
- Handling user inputs and interactions

It’s exciting to see an idea come to life, and I’m eager to keep improving and adding more features in the future.

## 📱 Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Check off tasks as you complete them.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list when no longer needed.

## 🌟 Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** For building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **Dart:** The programming language used in Flutter.
- **Hive:** A lightweight and fast local database used for storing task data on the device.
